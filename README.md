# go-rest-template

Basic Rest-API template featuring a `pong` and `jwt` endpoint, to generate a jwt token. Uses logging and jwt auth in the middleware. 
You can use this to setup the basics of your api. 

There is **no** real authentication. You still need to connect your database and veryfiy the user before you generate the JWT.
